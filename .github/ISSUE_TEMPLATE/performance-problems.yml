        What are you doing when the lag happens? Are you shooting a gun, causing explosions, running commands?

        Do you best to be as descriptive as possible here. Performance problems can be difficult to pinpoint, so it is important we have a list of instructions on how we can repoduce the error.
        You should be including all of your weapons config (Put the `WeaponMechanics` folder into a zip file and upload it here).
        Usually, a performance problem occurs during the usage of a specific weapon. Try testing 1 weapon at a time until you find which one causes the lag.

        Tip: You can "drag and drop" files into the text box to upload images, logs, videos, or other files.
      value: |
        Paste your `WeaponMechanics` folder into a `.zip` file and upload it.

        ```yaml
        # Paste config snippets here, if applicable. Otherwise, delete this bit.
        ```

        Include steps to repoduce, like:
        1. Spawn in my minigun using `/wm get Minigun`
        2. Spin around 4 times
        3. Open and close your inventory
        4. Shoot the minigun
        5. You'll notice lagspikes start to occur after this
