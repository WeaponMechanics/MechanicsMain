/**
 * A projectile script is a class that can be attached to a projectile. The
 * script can listen for projectile related events (colliding with blocks, for
 * example). The {@link AProjectile} class stores a list of scripts, and each
 * script is updated for each event.
 *
 * <p>In order for you to attach a script to a projectile, you need to register
 * your {@link ProjectileScriptManager} (which handles which projectiles to use)
 * using {@link ProjectilesRunnable#addScriptManager(ProjectileScriptManager)}.
 *
 * <p>While you can use bukkit events and scripts interchangeably, scripts have
 * the added advantage of better OOP and less overhead from the EventHandler.
 * Scripts may also allow better control over when you want code to execute.
 *
 * @param <T> The projectile type the script expects.
