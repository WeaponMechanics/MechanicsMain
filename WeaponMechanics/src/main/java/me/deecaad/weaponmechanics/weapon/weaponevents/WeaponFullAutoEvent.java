 * <p>Note that all changes are kept until the task is cancelled. This means
 * that changes are <i>semi-permanent</i>. If you want to change the full-auto
 * rate of a current gun, you should get the {@link FullAutoTask} from an
 * entity's hand data.
 *
 * <p>If you want to "reset" the rate later, you should call this event so
 * other plugins, like WeaponMechanicsPlus, can modify the fire rate again.
