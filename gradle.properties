# "devMode" is a flag designed to be used by new developers looking to make
# changes to WeaponMechanics. It disables all "legacy" compatibility modules
# (the ones that require you to use BuildTools for the first time). This means
# that the .jar files you build will be smaller, and they won't work on MC 1.16
# or below. This is useful for testing, but you should not use it for production.
# devMode=true

# This is used for publishing to maven central. This is required since have
# multiple projects that need to be published to maven central.
